              Thesis: Peace is Only a Short Break
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed font-serif">
              This report sees <span class="italic">Blood Meridian</span> as a book where peace is not a final goal but a quick flash in a world controlled by war. Every time the violence stops—like friends around a fire, or a religious moment, or the Kid’s small acts of kindness—it is only a weak pause in what Judge Holden calls the “ultimate game.” The book’s structure, people, and places all point to the idea that peace is just a local weather change in a world that is always at war.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base text-neutral-800 leading-relaxed font-serif">
              By looking at the Kid’s journey with the Glanton gang, studying the Judge as a thinker on war, and placing the story in its real-world setting on the U.S.–Mexico border in the late 1840s, we can see how the book changes war from a historical event into a basic rule of life. Because of this, peace seems short-lived, flawed, and always about to be erased.

              War as the Main Rule of the World
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed font-sans">
              In this novel, war is not just what people do; it is what the world is made of. Judge Holden says that war is the “truest form of divination,” a way to read the future in blood and destruction. The Glanton gang rides through deserts and border towns as if they are on a special ground where every group—the army, the church, the trading post—ends up helping or failing to stop this bigger, constant violence.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-base leading-relaxed font-sans">
              The next parts show how peace only appears briefly at the edges of this war-world: in the Kid’s small moments of mercy, in rare acts of kindness, in the hope for law and treaties. We will see that each of these moments is quickly pulled back into the Judge’s main belief that nothing is important unless it can be counted in the history of fighting.

          The events in the novel happen during the U.S.–Mexico War and in the border areas between Texas, Chihuahua, Sonora, and the lands of the Apache and Comanche people. Knowing this setting shows that the book does not start in peace and then turn to war; instead, war is already happening, and the characters are simply moving inside it.

              The southwestern border in the 1840s was a place with many wars happening at once:

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
              <li>

              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">U.S.–Mexico War</span> (1846–1848) makes the conquest official, but on the ground, raids, revenge attacks, and scalp rewards keep the violence going long after the official peace agreement.

              <li>
                <span class="font-semibold">Comanche and Apache fighting back</span> turned the area into a long-running border war even before the U.S. arrived.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              McCarthy’s Glanton gang rides right after the official treaty, but the book makes it clear that “peace” is just a fake idea on paper. Local leaders in Mexico hire the gang to hunt scalps, which is basically paying for war even after it was supposed to be over.

            The setting itself shows the main conflict: peace is only a legal cover that excuses or hides the war that is still going on. The Judge later turns this political fact into a deep belief: what matters is not a treaty but the total way that fighting fills all of existence.
